        <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>I graduated from the Pennsylvania State University with a bachelors degree
            in Electrical Engineering as a Schreyers Honors Student. My industry 
            experience includes the title of systems engineer, embedded systems engineer 
            and electronics engineer with a focus on electronic circuit design and 
            signal integrity.
         <br>
            I am a self-taught web developer looking to enter into the world of Web3 and 
            this online portfolio hihglights my journey, my accomplishments, and my personal 
            projects. In my free time I enjoy completing different coding projects and 
            creating educational content that teaches people about cryptocurrencies and 
            Web3. When I am away from the computer, I am outdoors hiking, or reading books
            about personal developementor technology.</p>

                <p>I designed the electromyography (EMG) circuit to take the voltages produced 
                    in a muscle, and convert it into information that can be read by a microcontroller 
                    or computer in order to move a robotic arm. The voltages in the muscle are very small 
                    (0-10 millivolts). The EMG circuit takes this small, AC signal, amplifies it, filters 
                    it to eliminate noise, and rectifies the signal to convert it into a positive DC voltage 
                    that a computer can understand. This research project works specifically on the bicep 
                    muscle and was completed as my senior and honors Capstone project at Penn State.</p>
